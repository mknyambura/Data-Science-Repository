# Cat-Dog-Image-Classifier

### In this project, i will show you how to use Convolutional Neural Network to classify and make a prediction on a image to show whether it is a cat or a dog.

### A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other. The pre-processing required in a ConvNet is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms. While in primitive methods filters are hand-engineered, with enough training, ConvNets have the ability to learn these filters/characteristics.
