# Neural-Network-CIFAR-10-Image-Classification

#### I am going to explain how we can train a neural network model for the task of image classification with TensorFlow. For those new to TensorFlow, TensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It is a generalization of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimentions. Tensorflow represents tensors as n-dimentional arrays of base datatypes. Tenso

#### Tensorflow has a comprehensive and flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that allow researchers to push cutting-edge advancements in ML, and developers to easily build and deploy machine learning-based applications.

# What is Image Classification?

#### Image classification is the process of categorizing and labelling groups of pixels or vectors in an image according to specific rules. The categorization law can be designed using one or more spectral or textural characteristics.

#### Now, Image Classification can also be done by using less complex models provided by Scikit-Learn, so why TensorFlow. By using TensorFlow we can build a neural network for the task of Image Classification. By building a neural network we can discover more hidden patterns than just classification.

# CIFAR-10 Dataset

#### The CIFAR-10 dataset (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) is a collection of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision algorithms. 
### The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are 6,000 images of each class.

#### NOTE: **Computer algorithms for recognizing objects in photos often learn by example. CIFAR-10 is a set of images that can be used to teach a computer how to recognize objects. Since the images in CIFAR-10 are low-resolution (32x32), this dataset can allow researchers to quickly try different algorithms to see what works.**
