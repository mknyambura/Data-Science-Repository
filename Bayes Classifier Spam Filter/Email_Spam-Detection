# Bayes-Classifier-Spam-Filter

### Email spam, are also called as junk emails, are unsolicited messages sent in bulk by email (spamming).

### In this Data Science Project I will show you how to detect email spam using Machine Learning technique called Natural Language Processing and Python.

### So this program will detect if an email is spam (1) or not (0).
### We use the Naive Bayes classifier which is suitable for classification with discrete features.

### We get to see how well our model performed by evaluating the Naive Bayes classifier and the report, confusion matrix & accuracy score
